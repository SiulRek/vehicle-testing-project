Could you please specify the range of the "level of aggressiveness" and how it quantitatively affects the demand speed?
What types of data (e.g., vehicle parameters, environmental factors) can we expect to receive to inform the demand speed calculations?
How does the "level of aggressiveness" correlate with actual driving behavior, and are there any thresholds or specific patterns that should be replicated by the software?
What format should the interface of the developed software have? What are the requirements of the input and output of our systems?
What are the performance metrics and accuracy requirements for the simulation in terms of matching the human-driven energy consumption data?
Are there any specific compliance standards or regulations that the software needs to adhere to during development? If yes, which ones?
Can you provide details on the vehicle parameters that should be considered when calculating the theoretical difference in energy consumption?
Is it possible that you provide us with the initial datasets  for preliminary testing and calibration of our software?
In terms of the operational concept, are there any specific requirements for logging, reporting, or user interaction that need to be incorporated into the software design?
Is there a preference for the software to be platform-dependent or platform-independent, and do you have any requirements regarding the operating system or hardware?
Are there any specific features or tools that the users would like to have within the software to analyze the results, such as data visualization or comparison tools?
Will the software be integrated with other systems or databases, and if so, can you provide details on these systems for proper interface design?
What are the key outputs you expect from the software following a simulation run, and in what formats (e.g., CSV, PDF reports, graphical displays)?
How would you like the software to handle exceptions or out-of-bounds conditions during simulations?
