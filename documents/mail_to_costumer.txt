Dear Mr. Seewald,

Thanks for the opportunity to contribute on your companies projects. We would glad to get answer to the following questions:

What range should we use for the "level of aggressiveness," and how should it change the demand speed?
What kind of data, like vehicle details and environmental conditions, will you give us for the demand speed settings?
How should the "level of aggressiveness" reflect real driving? Are there specific patterns we should include?
Could you tell us what you need for the software's input and output formats?
What accuracy do you expect from our simulations, particularly when comparing energy use to a real driver?
Are there any specific rules or standards the software needs to follow while we develop it?
Which vehicle details are important for estimating energy use differences?
Could you provide some initial data for us to start testing and adjusting our software?
What are your needs for recording data, making reports, and how users will interact with the software?
Do you want the software to work on specific platforms or systems, and what are the technical requirements for this?
Are there special analysis tools or features you'd like to see in the software?
If the software will connect to other systems or databases, can you describe what those are?
What information do you expect after simulations, and how would you like it presented?
How should the software respond when things don't go as planned during simulations?
Can you describe the specific situations where you'll use the software? This will help us make sure it fits your needs.
Are there any performance tests you want us to run on the software to make sure it works well?
Will users need to log in to use the software, and should we add security for this?
Are you able to provide us any help features or training materials built into the software?
In the case of errors or interruptions, what steps would you like the software to take automatically?
If there's a need for technical support or help with the software, what kind of assistance would be most useful for your team?
Do you have any experience regarding the topic of the project you would like to share with us?


Please provide your responses and any additional specifications as defined in the project timeline.

We look forward to your detailed input to move start and complete the project successfully.
